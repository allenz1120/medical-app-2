# medical-app-2
 
## Summary of Goals and Accomplishments
Our team hoped to create a medical information platform with the ability to register new users or show existing users pertinent information about their healthcare provider. The login and registration screens leverage our MySQL database to authenticate users, which are then automatically navigated to the home screen. The home screen displays their current PCP, along with a card asking to confirm email and address, and a map displaying both the user's home address and their PCP address. The PCP, email, and address data is also sourced from the MySQL database, while the map was implemented using the MapBox API.
